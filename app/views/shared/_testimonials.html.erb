                            Our Birthday Party was great because of this Awesome WeddiPuppa. Our guests said it was the best party they had attended and the Classical Violin Concerto was just wonderful.

                            We throughly enjoyed everything they provided for us for our wedding reception, they did a great job! They took a lot of stress off of our shoulders when it came to planning our event, they pretty much took care of everything for us.
